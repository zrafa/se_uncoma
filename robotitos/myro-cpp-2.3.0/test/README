This directory contains files that use the Myro-Cpp library

These programs serve two purposes:
  1.) To test functionality of the Myro-Cpp library
  2.) To serve as example code on how to accomplish certain tasks using
        the myro-cpp library.


All of these programs should be installed as part of the Myro-Cpp library, 
    with the prefix of myro_.

So, test_camera.cpp should be compiled and installed as myro_test_camera, 
    likewise for all the other files here.

Also included is a Makefile that could be used to compile these programs 
    (however, without the myro_ prefix stated before).
